Hello,

This project is a test project announced during the interview. This project was a test to check a series of functions including a basic third-person character movement function, inventory management, and path-finding technology.

We implemented a new modern path-finding technology.

We also used a new method for the input event system to fit the characteristics of PC games. We also implemented a new function for the rotation of the view.

In UI processing, we configured the UI using the MVC method using Action + Invoke according to the tester's request.

Anyway, this project was written according to the tester's specific requirements, so it cannot be perfect in all aspects.

Thank you, Adrian.
